# Electronjs small desktop app
Image resizer. Just clone the project, npm i, and then to run the process:
npm start OR npx electronmon .
This last will watch for life changes in case you want to modify the app.

## Just a first approach
The main learning of this demo is to discover the core functionalities of electronjs but as a matter of fact it really helped me refresh a lot of concepts and core modules of nodejs, like the file system.
To wrap the app into an executable, one needs to use something like electron package. I might do that any time in the future.
